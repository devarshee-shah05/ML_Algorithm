    "- The basic idea is to train several predictors sequentially allowing each predictor to correct the inaccuracies of the previous one.\n",
    "- One disadvantage of this method is that it has a limited ability to be parallelized as each predictor can only be trained after the precious predictor has been trained and evaluated."
