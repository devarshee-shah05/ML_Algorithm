    "- The averaged one-dependence estimators or AODE algorithm is a probabilistic classification learning technique similar to the Naïve Bayes classifier.\n",
    "- It performs classification by aggregating the predictions of multiple one-dependence classifiers in which all attributes depend on the same single parent attribute as well as the class.\n",
    "- Furthermore, it is also possible to add weights to specific averaged one-dependence estimators features. This method is known as WAODE, where the ‘W’ stands for weighted."
